List of new RFPs and upcoming deadlines for open solicitations. Opportunties included cover domains such as AI, CLimate & Sustainability, Finance & Banking, Healthcare & Life Science, Research & Development, and Science & Technology. 

I've taken over helping projects through the process of submission deadlines and Lindsay assist with all of the budgeting pieces and any other questions prior to the approval of a proposal; additionally Linday takes over the reporting requirements, communications, and all miscellaneous project needs after acceptance.

Please share any comments or feedback on any of the opportunties you would be interested in pursuing or if there's one you'd like to discuss further to see if it aligns. Please notify MK @opencodeforgood or email giving@numfocus.org with the Issue #.
